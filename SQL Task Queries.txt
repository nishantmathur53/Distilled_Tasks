select date_of_lead,count(ad_id) as Number_of_ads
from public."Distilled1"
group by date_of_lead

2. Determine the YoY growth of leads in county Dublin from 2018 to 2020 (use lag).

--Second Query Solution--

with leads_cte as (
select extract(year from date_of_lead) as Years,sum(leads) as Leads,date_of_lead
from public."Distilled1"
where county = 'Dublin'
group by extract(year from date_of_lead),date_of_lead)

select Years,sum(Leads) as Total_leads,
cast(round(coalesce((sum(Leads)-lag(sum(Leads),1) over (order by Years))*1.0/lag(sum(Leads),1) over (order by Years),0),2) as decimal(10,2)) as Percnt_diff
from leads_cte where date_of_lead between '2017-01-01' and '2020-12-31'
